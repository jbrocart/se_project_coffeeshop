# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I'd like to update the styling of the layout and use different fonts for the headers. Such as the first one you see on the webpage.
